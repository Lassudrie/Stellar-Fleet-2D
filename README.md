# Stellar-Fleet-2D

Prototype Phaser 3 project structure.

Open `index.html` to access the HTML main menu. Clicking **New Game** now starts the Phaser game directly on the empire setup form without leaving the page.

## Progressive Web App

The project now includes a `manifest.json` and a service worker so it can be installed and run offline like a standard PWA.

## Main Scene

As the game launches, players are greeted by a sleek, animated main menu interface set against a backdrop of a distant galaxy — stars glimmer, planets rotate slowly, and distant fleets glide silently across the void. The main navigation panel is centered or aligned to the left, depending on the screen layout, and includes the following options:

- New Game – Start a fresh campaign. Players can choose a faction, configure galaxy settings (number of systems, AI difficulty, etc.), and name their empire.

- Load Game – Browse and load from a list of previous save files.

- Codex – Access a rich in-universe encyclopedia containing lore, faction profiles, ship classes, and gameplay mechanics.

- Credits – View the team behind the game.

- Exit – Close the game and return to the desktop.

Hovering over each option triggers subtle UI animations and ambient sounds, reinforcing the futuristic and tactical atmosphere of the game.
